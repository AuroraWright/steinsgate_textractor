# Steins;Gate Textractor
Only works for the original game, not Zero. This is a proof of concept, 
can easily be adapted to copy to clipboard for standard texthooker such 
as ITHVNR or NextHooker. Character mapping was provided by 
[CommitteeOfZero](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/SciAdv.Net/blob/master/src/SciAdvNet.SC3/Data/SteinsGateZero/Charset.utf8), 
all other work was done by me. I believe this works for all versions of 
Steins;Gate, no guarantees though.
> Note: Neither menus nor popups are handled, and not all text on the 
cell phone is handled, such as names on the contacts screen.
### Build Instructions
Made with VS2017, requires any windows SDK, otherwise should compile 
out-of-the-box.
### Use Instructions
Not the most useful tool (only prints to console), but running it after 
Steins;Gate is started should do the trick. It will print any new text 
bubbles to console, and will print e-mail sender, subject, and body when 
upon opening said e-mail.
### Sample Images
It's self-explanatory.
